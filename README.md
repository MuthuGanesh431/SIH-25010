## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
A Smart Crop Advisory Mobile Platform combining AI + IoT + local language support:

Multilingual App + Voice Chatbot (Tamil, Hindi, Punjabi, etc.).

Soil & Crop Advisory using soil-test inputs + AI-based fertilizer suggestions.

Weather-based Insights (rain prediction, sowing/harvest alerts).

Pest/Disease Detection via image upload → AI model suggests cure + pesticide/fertilizer dosage.

Market Price Tracker → links farmers to nearest mandis.

Offline Mode → works even in low internet areas.

Continuous Feedback Loop → farmers’ experience improves system accuracy.

## Technical Approach
Farmer Data Input: Voice/text in local language, soil details, past crops.

AI Processing Layer:

NLP for local languages

Image Recognition (pest/disease)

Weather API + Market API integration

ML-based recommendation system

Output Delivery: Simple advisory in text, audio, or chatbot.

Feedback Capture: Farmer confirms yield/issue solved → system learns.

## Feasibility and Viability
### Feasibility:

Works on low-end smartphones.

AI models trained on regional crops.

Integration with government soil/market data.

### Challenges:

Low literacy → solved with voice support.

Internet issues → solved with offline mode.

Trust-building → solved via NGO & govt. partnerships.

### Viability:

Economic: reduces costs, increases yield (20–30%).

Social: empowers farmers.

Environmental: reduces overuse of chemicals.

## Impact and Benefits
### Social

Empowers small & marginal farmers with scientific decision-making.

Reduces dependency on middlemen and shopkeepers.

Builds trust in technology through native language + voice support.

### Economic

Increases crop yield by 20–30% through optimized advisory.

Reduces input costs (fertilizers, pesticides) by avoiding overuse.

Provides better income by connecting to real-time market price data.

### Environmental

Promotes sustainable farming by minimizing chemical misuse.

Encourages balanced soil health through proper nutrient management.

Reduces water wastage with weather-linked irrigation guidance.

### Long-Term Benefits

Strengthens rural economy and food security.

Scalable model → can be adopted across states.

Continuous feedback loop ensures the system improves over time.

## Research and References
NABARD Report 2022 → 86% small/marginal farmers.

FAO studies → ICT advisories improve yield by 20–30%.

Govt. Kisan Suvidha app (baseline inspiration, but lacks AI + local personalization).
